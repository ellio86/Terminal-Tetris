# Terminal Tetris

This is a windows based project, using the python programming language and the windows-curses python module.

The project is essentially a 20*10 array representing the tetris board and each piece is set to fall once a second.
There are 2 sizes of board that you can play (One of them is just twice the size of the other), which you'll be able 
to choose between once I create a menu system.

The reason for creating this was solely just to see if I could.

Enjoy.
